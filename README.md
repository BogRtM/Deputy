## Known issues

Animation smoothing is currently jank. This isn't something that will affect gameplay, but under certain conditions you may see weird snapping between animations. It is something I am actively working on.

# The Deputy

The Deputy is an extremely mobile run-and-gun survivor who whittles enemies down with her revolvers before finishing them off with massive burst damage from her Special.

Tips
• Use Shooting Star immediately after Crashing Comet to quickly traverse long distances.<br/>
• Get a Wax Quail.<br/>
• Gun Sling can be used to cancel your downwards momentum.

This survivor was inspired by the Ranger from Dungeon & Fighter.
