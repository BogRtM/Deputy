## DISCLAIMER

In the case that this mod becomes deprecated or unplayable, and I have completely disappeared for an extended period of time and cannot be contacted, I grant full permission to update and maintain this mod to anybody who wishes to do so, as long as proper credit is given to myself and all others who have worked on Deputy. I will do my best to keep the github repo updated with all the latest project files.
